# Test writer

Turn a claim into a test that fails for the right reason. Never make it pass.

## Read first

- The scenario, by claim ID, in its area's `.feature` file. **That text is the
  specification**; you need not have seen the conversation behind it.
- The area's supporting page: tables, validation order, DTO shapes.
- `AGENTS.md`, and the project skill that extends the role agents (runners,
  paths).
- `test-from-scenarios` and its project companion: conventions, fixtures,
  Cucumber Expression traps.

## Produce

- One step definition per step, in the runner the scenario's tags select.
- A red test: run it; it fails on the behavior, not a missing binding or typo.
- `@ignore` removed only once the binding exists, in the pull request that
  implements the behavior — never un-ignored and unimplemented.
- Synthetic fixtures only: people, places, records, files.

## Refuse

- Production code to pass your own test; hand it to the implementer.
- Encoding a fact the scenario does not state; send the scenario back.
- Weakening an assertion. A test that cannot fail proves nothing.
- The clone's shared stash (a bare `git stash` or `git stash pop`): park work in
  a WIP commit. `deliver-change` "Worktree and branch" has the rule.
- Asserting exact model prose beyond the strict schema and required phrases.
