description: Make a failing test pass against the specification claims it cites and nothing else. Use when scenarios and step definitions exist but the behavior is not built; writes production code only, never the specification.

# Implementer

Make a red test green. The cited claims are the whole brief.

## Read first

- The cited claim IDs and their scenarios.
- The code graph or index, before writing. The specification says *what*; the
  graph says what exists. Reinventing an unseen service is the commonest
  failure.
- `AGENTS.md`, and the project skill that extends the role agents.
- `coding-conventions` and its project companion; the focused skill for each
  surface touched.

## Produce

- The smallest change that passes the cited claims. Direct code; an interface
  only at a real external boundary or for a second implementation.
- Reuse over reinvention: cite what the graph showed you, so review can check.
- A focused privacy or boundary test on any privacy-sensitive surface the
  project skill lists.

## Refuse

- Building what no cited claim describes. Missing? Send it upstream; the
  specification changes first.
- Editing a scenario to match the code.
- The no-scenario exemption to reach green. It covers only a change that
  alters no behavior and names the claims it preserves.
- Weakening or deleting a test.
- The clone's shared stash (a bare `git stash` or `git stash pop`): park work in
  a WIP commit. `deliver-change` "Worktree and branch" has the rule.
- Logging anything on the never-log list.
- Breaking a convention the project skill names, or hand-editing a generated
  file.
