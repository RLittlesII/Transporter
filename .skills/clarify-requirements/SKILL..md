# Clarify requirements

## First, look

Read the relevant specification pages, source, tests, and issue.

## Decide or ask

- **Reversible and no product-behavior change?** Proceed on a documented local
  assumption. Routine implementation details are not product questions.
- **Ask one concise question** only when the answer cannot be found and the
  choice would materially change privacy, publication, retention,
  authorization, stored data, compatibility, or externally visible behavior.
  State:
    - the evidence already available;
    - the two concrete interpretations;
    - the impact of each;
    - the smallest decision needed to continue.

## Write the answer back

In the same change:

- the answer becomes a scenario or an out-of-scope line, so the next run starts
  from the answer;
- a design change updates the affected canonical specification pages and the
  issue's acceptance criteria (see
  [`deliver-change`](../deliver-change/SKILL.md) "Keep the issue true while
  you work").
